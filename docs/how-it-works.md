# How it Works

Particle leverages its team to source some of the world’s great works of art and enables the Particle community to use its collective purchasing power to add them to its collection. Every piece of art is ‘particalized’ into a subdivision of unique NFTs called Particles –representing minority ownership in the works in question. The physical works are then transferred to the Particle Foundation, a non-profit public trust and physical museum whose purpose is to maintain, preserve, and display the collection on behalf of the Particle community. 

Some works are transferred temporarily until the community of their respective Particle collectors decide they would like to part ways with it, others are forever placed in the Foundation –creating the basis of one of the world's greatest art collections governed by the community.

**The Particularization Process**

Step 1. Source: The community sources promising artists and works of art.
Step 2. Curate: The community via the DAO acquires art pieces to be added to the museum.
Step 3. Fractionalize: New additions are fractionalized and dispersed to the community to be used as governance tokens over the future of that art.
Step 4. Custody: The physical works of art are placed in a foundation for safe custody
Step 5. Access: NFT holders possess privileged access to all the works of art in the museum.
Step 6. Own: The community possesses the sole privilege of retaining or reselling its artwork.
