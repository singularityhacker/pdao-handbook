# ParticleDAO

ParticleDAO is the first permissionless collector DAO in history. The Particle ecosystem has untied the Gordian knot of decentralized ownership. ParticleDAO makes anyone anywhere a collector. Particle brings unprecedented evolution and innovation in ownership, curation, and custody.

A DAO, or a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a group of like-minded individuals who coordinate actions and decisions through democratic processes â€“ often through smart contracts. Collector DAOs are DAOs specifically organized to pool resources in order to purchase and co-own valuable assets. Collector DAOs, however, have often been limited in the types of items they can own and their governance. The Particle ecosystem changes this.

Particle empowers both individuals and creators by giving the everyday art enthusiast the same access that has historically been reserved for a select few. Creators and emerging artists are put on a level playing field where their work can be recognized, appreciated, and owned by anyone and anywhere. Individuals can get access to artists and artworks that have historically been inaccessible. Particle is bringing about a democratic art ownership revolution.
