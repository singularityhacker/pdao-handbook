Our mission is to acquire, safe keep, govern, and share humanityâ€™s great works of art.

This entails:
Democratizing the collection, stewardship, and preservation of art for the Particle community
Building value, utility, and growth for the Particle collection
Ensuring that a good-faith relationship is created with artists in the curation of their works of art
Disrupting the traditional art market in a way that makes art accessible to everyday people
Pursuing a world where artists benefit from their work and intellectual property in perpetuity
