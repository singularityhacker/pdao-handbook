Every piece of art is ‘particalized’ into a subdivision of unique NFTs called Particles –representing minority ownership in the works in question. The physical works are then transferred to the Particle Foundation, a non-profit public trust and physical museum whose purpose is to maintain, preserve, and display the collection on behalf of the Particle community.",
